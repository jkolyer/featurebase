# FeatureBase

## Managing the feature lifecycle

#### [PROTOTYPE]

FeatureBase is a Rails app designed to manage the entire feature lifecycle, from conception through maintainence, versioning and deprecation.  

The app works as an in-house system supporting all stages of feature development, used by product managers, developers, QA, and devops.
